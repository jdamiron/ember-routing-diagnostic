# Ember Routing Diagnostic

Record your responses inside the fenced code blocks below each question.

1.  What are the main task(s) you perform inside the Ember Application Router,
    and what are the main task(s) you perform inside an Ember Route?

    ```md
    The main task to perform in the application router is
    configuering routes using this.route(''), so the router knows
    which route to point to at the correct time. The main task in an
    Ember route is to provide a model hook which returns information
    similar to the structure of JSON.
    ```

1.  What is the command to generate a route named `boston` nested under
    `campus`?

    ```md
    ember g route campus/boston
    ```

1.  Suppose you have a nested route at the URL `/campus/boston`. How would you
    use the `link-to` helper to generate an appropriate link?

    ```md
    {{#link-to 'campus.boston'}}Boston Campus{{/link-to}}
    ```

1.  Explain **at least** two differences between the following two route
    definitions.

    ```js
    this.route('products', function () {
      this.route('product', { path: '/:product_id' }); // <= 👀here
    });

    this.route('product', { path: '/products/:product_id' }); // <= 👀 here
    ```

    ```md
    One difference is in the first block, product is nested inside of products.
    The second difference is the path's are different, the second block acts
    as the root route for product rather than products since this is the top
    most route for product.
    ```

1.  Suppose we have the following route definition:

    ```js
    this.route('movie', { path: '/movies/:movie_id' }); // <= 👀 here
    ```

    If we navigate in the browser to `/movies/123`, how can we reference the
    value `'123'` inside a Route?

    ```md
    params.movie_id
    ```

1.  Inside a template, how do we reference data provided by a Route?

    ```md
    Using double curly braces ( {{ }} ) allows you to access
    data returned from the model hook in the route.
    ```
